## About This Project:

"Image Finder" is a React-based web application that allows users to search for images using the Pexabay API. This application is built using Material-UI components and Material icons for a clean and modern user interface. The app uses Axios to fetch data from the Pexabay API, providing users with access to several images.

With "Image Finder," users can search for images using keywords to find the perfect image for their project. The application provides a seamless user experience with real-time image search results.

This project is a great example of how to build a modern web application using React, Material-UI, and Axios. With its easy-to-use interface and powerful search capabilities, "Image Finder" is the perfect tool for designers, developers, and content creators looking for high-quality images to enhance their work.
